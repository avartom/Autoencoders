# Autoencoders

Here's the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08692.pdf

In this section, we will perform the same time of process but on a smaller and simpler scale - though the basic idea is the same. We will train an auto-encoder to restore damaged images. The beautiful and beneficial thing about performing the same basic restoration process but on a simpler problem is that we are able to understand the basic process without too many complications.
